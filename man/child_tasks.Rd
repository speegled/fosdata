Time that it takes children to complete various activities.

\details{
More information on the activities of the children.
\enumerate{
  \item The day-night test. Children are told to say "day" when shown a picture of the moon and stars,
  and to say "night" when shown a picture of the sun. Time to complete test and number correct (0 incorrect,
  1 point for self-corrected, 2 points for correct) are measured.
  \item Counting-span test. Children were required to count the number of red dots on cards, and recall the
  number of dots without looking at them. Given in sets of 1 through 5. Max score of 15.
  \item Digit Span Backward. Children were read from 2-8 numbers and asked to recite them backwards. Two
  numbers repeated 4 times, and the rest repeated twice. Max score of 16.
  \item Card-sort task. Children sorted cards that were blue/red with either bunnies/boats on them into boxes
  that had either pictures of boats and bunnies or were blue and red. Time to sort and a correctness score
  were measured.
  \item Shape Trail Test. In trial A the children were to connect the dots in order from 1-15. In trial B
  the children were to connect the dots (1-8 circles and 1-7 squares) in order, alternating between circles
  and squares. Time to completion was measured.

From the authors: "In this paper we report an initial validation of the Shape Trail Testâ€“Child Version (STT-CV) with a non-clinical sample of children aged 6 to 9 years. The STT-CV has been developed as an age-appropriate and culturally fair direct downward extension of the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of cognitive flexibility."
