#' Gray haired chimpanzees
#'
#' It is known that humans' hair generally turns gray as they age. Is the same true for chimpanzees? This
#' data set contains demographic information on chimpanzees, together with human ratings of how gray their
#' hair is. The authors' original intent was to determine whether middle-aged chimpanzees got gray with
#' age.
#'
#' From the authors: "The greying of human head hair is arguably the most salient marker of human aging. In wild mammal populations, greying can change with life history or environmental factors (e.g., sexual maturity in silverback gorillas). Yet, whether humans are unique in our pattern of age-related hair depigmentation is unclear."
