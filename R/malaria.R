#' Malaria Transmission and Parasites
#'
#' Mice were bit 10 times by mosquitoes, and the number of salivary gland sporozoites detected in the mosquitoes was
#' measured. The mice were then observed to determine whether they got malaria. Some of the mice were given a malarial
#' antibody pre-mosquito bite.
#'
#' From the authors: "Over a century since Ronald Ross discovered that malaria is caused by the bite of an infectious mosquito it is still unclear how the number of parasites injected influences disease transmission. Currently it is assumed that all mosquitoes with salivary gland sporozoites are equally infectious irrespective of the number of parasites they harbour, though this has never been rigorously tested."
