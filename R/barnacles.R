#' Barnacle Counts
#'
#' The count of barnacles on coral reef in the Flower Garden Banks.
#'
#' From the authors: "Bioerosion, the removal of calcium carbonate from coral frameworks by living organisms, influences a variety of reef features, from their topographic complexity to the net balance of carbonate budgets. Little is known, however, about how macroborers, which bore into reef substrates leaving traces greater than 0.1 mm diameter, are distributed across coral reefs, particularly reef systems with high (>50%) stony coral cover or at mesophotic depths (â‰¥30 m)."
