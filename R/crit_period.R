#' Critical Period Hypothesis
#'
#' The age of onset of acquisition and ultimate level of attainment of second language learners in North America and Israel.
#'
#' From the author: "In second language acquisition research, the critical period hypothesis (cph) holds that the function between learners' age and their susceptibility to second language input is non-linear. This paper revisits the indistinctness found in the literature with regard to this hypothesis's scope and predictions."
